        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
          I am a software developer in the Madison, WI metro area. I'm a person
          who values his family deeply and a person who takes deep pride in his
          work.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I spent the 10 years before I became a software developer employed as
          a mill worker, working on teams of 6-9 people. During that time I
          continually found enjoyment working with people from varying walks of
          life. I love the idea that I will be able to do the same thing with
          people in software development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love that I enjoy the work in software
          development. I really enjoy puzzles, and thinking things through
          systemically, and doing those things with people only makes those
          activities more fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I've started my journey in Software Engineering I've created a few websites.
          Two of the most notable are  my <a href="https://blooming-mountain-client.herokuapp.com/dashboard">reservation app</a> 
          and a <a href="https://developerkaleb.github.io/Decoder_Ring_Project/">decoder ring project</a>.
