    <h2 class="wrapper">About Me</h2>
    <article class="wrapper">
      <p>I spent the 10 years before I became a software developer employed as a mill worker, working on teams of 6-9 people. During that time I continually found enjoyment working with people from varying walks of life. I love the idea that I will be able to do the same thing with people in software development. 
      Except in software development I will actually enjoy the work. I really enjoy puzzles, and thining things through systemically, and doing those things with people only makes those activities more fun.
