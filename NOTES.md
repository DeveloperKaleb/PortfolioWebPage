# Project Notes

Running notes on non-obvious decisions and gotchas hit while working on this repo.
`CLAUDE.md` covers what the codebase *is*; this covers *why* some things are the way
they are, so nobody re-debugs the same thing twice.

## Array Grid Toy layout (`#toyDisplay` in `style.css`)

`generateGridHtml()` (in `js/logic.js`) wraps each row's buttons in a `<div class="y{row}">`.
That's incompatible with CSS Grid (which `.butMania` uses everywhere else) — Grid treats
each row-wrapper as a single cell, so buttons get squeezed into it and wrap onto multiple
lines instead of laying out horizontally. `#toyDisplay` overrides to a flex column of flex
rows instead, which matches the actual DOM shape.

Buttons there also have `margin: 0` (unlike the shared `.butMania button` rule). Margin
can't shrink the way `flex-shrink` can, so with margin left in it becomes the dominant
fixed cost per button at high column counts and buttons stop shrinking well before the
container is actually full — looks like a "shrink is capped" bug even though it isn't.

Snake and Tetris don't hit either issue: their board-builders (`createStaticBoard`,
`createTetrisBoard`) emit buttons as flat direct children, which Grid handles natively.

## Entertainment hub navigation

`entertainment.html` is a single page with a hash-based view router in `entertainment.js`
(`#tetris` / `#snake` / `#toy`, empty = the hub grid). No routing library, no separate
pages per game — deliberate, to avoid duplicating nav/footer/script-include boilerplate
across more HTML files and to keep `entertainment.js` as the one DOM/state layer for all
three toys/games, matching how it already worked before the hub existed.

## Manual cache-busting (`LAST_UPDATED` in `scripts/footer.js`)

Every push needs **two** manual bumps, done together:
1. `LAST_UPDATED` in `scripts/footer.js` (human-readable, drives the footer text).
2. The `?v=YYYYMMDD-HHmm` query string on the `style.css` / `nav.js` / `footer.js` /
   `entertainment.js` tags in both `index.html` and `entertainment.html`.

**Why it's not just one shared JS constant:** a version computed from a JS file's own
contents can't cache-bust that same file's `<script src>` tag — the browser has to fetch
it first, and that fetch has no version on it, so a stale cached copy just hands back a
stale version that "correctly" busts everything else into other stale, previously-cached
copies. Don't try to route this through a single computed constant again; the literal
query string in the HTML is load-bearing.

## GitHub Pages absolute-path gotcha

Already documented in `CLAUDE.md` under "Path conventions" — repeating only because it's
easy to forget when adding a new page: `entertainment.html` and `scripts/nav.js` use
`/PortfolioWebPage/...` absolute paths, so the site only fully works served from that
exact subpath (GitHub Pages), not opened from a local file path or a differently-rooted
static server.

## Verifying changes

- Logic changes (`js/logic.js`): run `npm test` (vitest).
- Appearance-only changes (CSS/layout): the project owner prefers to check these
  themselves in a real browser rather than have Claude drive one — make the change,
  describe what should look different, hand it back.
- Functional/interactive bugs (something doesn't click, doesn't route, throws): worth
  verifying directly (local static server + browser console) rather than guessing from
  reading code alone — a `?v=`/module-import change, for example, is easy to reason about
  wrong on paper but is a 30-second check in a real page load.

## Previewing locally (`npm run dev`)

Use `npm run dev`. Opening `index.html` off the filesystem does *not* work: `nav.js` is
included from the absolute `/PortfolioWebPage/scripts/nav.js`, so under `file://` (or any
static server rooted at the repo) the nav bar and stylesheet 404 and the page renders
unstyled and un-navigable. The site needs to be served from that exact subpath.

`tools/dev-server.js` handles that by mapping the URL prefix onto the repo root — a
request for `/PortfolioWebPage/style.css` is served from `./style.css`. The obvious
alternative is making the folder name on disk match the URL (a symlink, or `mklink /J` on
Windows, since the repo directory is `portfolio-webpage`, not `PortfolioWebPage`). That
works, but it needs setting up and tearing down every time and leaves a stray link behind
if you forget; prefix-mapping needs nothing on disk. If `BASE_PATH` there ever disagrees
with `basePath` in `scripts/nav.js`, the nav breaks — they're one setting in two files.

Responses are sent `Cache-Control: no-store` deliberately. This repo cache-busts by hand
(see above), so a cached preview would quietly show you a stale page and hide the change
you're checking. Refresh is enough; no hard reload.

Flags: `--open` to launch a browser, `-- --port 8124` to move off the default 8123 (note
the extra `--`, which is what makes npm pass the flag through). Port already in use
usually means an older preview is still running.
